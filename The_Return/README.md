# The Return - Design Document

## Locations and Connections

### Intro

A thunder crack of splintering wood wrenches you from darkness. A scream of shock, heat and sweat floods onto the cold shaking ground. Reborn in moss and dirt you take one gasping breath ofacrid smoke then another, and another. You wretch and convulse awareness spreading feeling for breaks in muscle and bone, stretching out to fingers toes then retreating to slow a pounding heart. Senses waking you feel the moss on your face the earth in your mouth, aching trembling pushing up back onto your knees you open your eyes. 

Coming into focus dry roots wrap round sap covered arms you tear them off wiping the dirt from yourself. You grab a lose branch and use it to stand and prop yourself. In front of you the earth fades into a dense white fog.
