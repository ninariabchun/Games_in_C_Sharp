# Games in Unity

I have finished a course "Introduction to Video Games Creation" from XAMK Open University.
You can find it here: https://cambridge-academy-of-gaming-and-innovation.teachable.com/p/introduction-to-video-games-creation

During the course I have created following games:

1. Text Adventure - The Return
2. Interactive Combat Card Game - Merlin's Demon War
3. Mobile Game for Android - The Snake

An Overview of each game you can find in README files in the respective repository :)
