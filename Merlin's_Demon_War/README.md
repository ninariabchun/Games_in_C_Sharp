### The game begins:

Each player is dealt 3 cards from his deck. 

The player’s cards are face up and enemy’s face down. 

The turn counter says, ‘Player’s Turn’.

The card vanishes and an effect is emitted from Merlin card. 

The enemy card shows a hit effect and the damage to the amount on the attack card is taken. 

If the enemy card’s health is zero the enemy and its attack cards are destroyed, the player’s enemy kill counter goes up by one and a new enemy moves onto the play field, and 3 new play cards appear in the hand area.  (Otherwise the enemy card remains in place.)

The turn counter says, ‘Enemy Turn’. One of the enemy cards is chosen and turns face up before vanishing an effect is emitted from the enemy card. 

The Merlin card shows a hit effect and damage to the amount on the attack card is taken. 

If the Merlin card’s health is reduced to zero the Merlin card and its attack cards are destroyed.
